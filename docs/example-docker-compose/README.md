# Docker Compose Example

This is a simple example setup using Docker compose and a mock OAuth server.

To start run `docker compose up` and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
The mock creditials are username `User1` and password `pwd`.

Note: This is just a simple docker compose example and is not following all best practices for deploying a production system.
