# Docker Compose Example

This is a simple example setup using Docker compose and a mock OAuth server.

To start run `docker compose up` and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
The mock creditials are username `john.smith@gmail.com` and password `YakMaster123`.

Note: This is just a simple docker compose example and is not following all best practices for deploying a production system.
